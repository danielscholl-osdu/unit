# these tests differ from the Unit Core tests
# AWS Istio configuration has a different reason in the response for invalid token
# The responses still return 401  or 403 , but differ slightly in the reason of the response
# Therefore the tests are changed slightly to be less restrictive
#This is likely a temporary override until reasons and response codes are standardized by the forum
