## Overview

These Architecture Decision Records document the key design choices made in the Fork Management Template project. Each ADR explains the context, decision, rationale, and consequences of significant architectural choices that enable automated management of long-lived forks of upstream repositories.

## Quick Reference

### Core Architecture Decisions

**Three-Branch Strategy (ADR-001)**
- `main`: Stable production branch
- `fork_upstream`: Tracks upstream changes
- `fork_integration`: Conflict resolution workspace

**Automation Framework (ADR-002)**
- GitHub Actions for all workflow automation
- Self-configuring template repository pattern
- Scheduled and event-driven synchronization

**Two-Workflow Initialization (ADR-006)**
- Separated user interaction from repository setup
- Issue-driven configuration with progress updates
- Simplified state management and error handling

**Workflow Bootstrap Pattern (ADR-007)**
- Self-updating initialization workflows
- Ensures latest fixes are always available
- Solves the template version bootstrap problem

**Centralized Label Management (ADR-008)**
- All labels defined in `.github/labels.json`
- Created during repository initialization
- Single source of truth for label definitions

**Version Management (ADR-004)**
- Release Please with Conventional Commits
- Automated semantic versioning
- Upstream version reference tracking

**Configuration-Driven Template Sync (ADR-011)**
- `.github/sync-config.json` defines what files get synced
- Selective synchronization between template and forked repositories
- Automated cleanup of template-specific content

**Template Update Propagation (ADR-012)**
- Weekly automated template updates via `template-sync.yml`
- AI-enhanced PR descriptions for template changes
- Solves template drift problem for forked repositories

**Reusable GitHub Actions (ADR-013)**
- Custom composite action for AI-enhanced PR creation
- DRY principle for common workflow functionality
- Centralized AI integration with multiple provider support

**AI-Enhanced Workflows (ADR-014)**
- Claude Code CLI integration with MCP server support
- Multi-provider AI support (Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI)
- AI-powered security analysis and PR description generation

**Template-Workflows Separation (ADR-015)**
- Clean separation between template development and fork production workflows
- `.github/workflows/` for template development (not copied)
- `.github/template-workflows/` for fork production workflows (copied during init)
- Eliminates workflow pollution in fork repositories

**Initialization Security Handling (ADR-016)**
- Temporarily disables push protection during initialization
- Allows syncing upstream repositories with historical secrets
- Re-enables full security immediately after initialization
- Simple and maintainable approach without complex error handling

**MCP Server Integration Pattern (ADR-017)**
- Automatic MCP server configuration for GitHub Copilot Agent
- Maven MCP Server provides AI-enhanced dependency management
- Configuration stored in fork-resources for template-wide deployment
- Read-only MCP servers for security and Maven Central integration

**Fork-Resources Staging Pattern (ADR-018)**
- `.github/fork-resources/` as staging area for specialized template deployment
- Templates requiring custom deployment logic (issue templates, AI configs, prompts)
- Two-stage deployment: template staging â†’ fork final locations
- Integrates with sync configuration for automatic updates
