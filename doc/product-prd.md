# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Fork Management Template

## Intro

The Fork Management Template provides automated fork lifecycle management through GitHub Actions workflows by leveraging proven architectural patterns from enterprise DevOps practices. The template implements a comprehensive repository template that automates fork setup, upstream synchronization, conflict resolution, and release management while being optimized for GitHub's native features and requiring zero external dependencies.

This is a **multi-phase product** with each phase producing a detailed implementation specification. The current document defines the complete product vision while individual specs detail specific implementation phases.

## Goals and Context

### Project Objectives
* Provide zero-configuration fork repository deployment through GitHub template patterns
* Automate upstream synchronization with intelligent conflict detection and resolution
* Implement enterprise-grade branch protection and security scanning from initialization
* Enable semantic versioning and automated release management with upstream traceability
* Deliver scalable fork management that works across unlimited repository deployments
* Eliminate manual DevOps overhead while maintaining stability and security

### Key Success Criteria
* Repository deployment completes in under 5 minutes from template creation
* Upstream synchronization operates reliably on weekly schedule with conflict isolation
* Branch protection prevents unstable code from reaching production branches
* Release automation generates semantic versions with comprehensive changelogs
* Security scanning and compliance checks integrate seamlessly with development workflow
* Non-technical users can successfully deploy and configure fork repositories

## Product Architecture Strategy

### Core Design Philosophy
**Template-Driven Automation**: Leverage GitHub's native template repository pattern with self-configuring workflows that adapt to specific upstream repositories while maintaining consistent automation patterns.

### Implementation Approach
```
Template Creation → Issue-Based Configuration → Automated Setup → Continuous Sync → Release Management
```

1. **Template Repository**: Complete workflow suite with placeholder configurations
2. **Self-Configuration**: Issue-driven setup process for upstream repository connection
3. **Automated Initialization**: Branch structure, protection rules, and security scanning
4. **Continuous Integration**: Scheduled sync with conflict detection and resolution workflows

## Multi-Specification Strategy

### Specification Management

Each implementation phase produces a detailed specification document:

1. **Spec Creation Trigger**: When phase requirements are finalized and architecture validated
2. **Spec Validation**: Each spec must pass comprehensive testing before next phase begins
3. **Spec Evolution**: Specifications may be updated based on implementation learnings
4. **Cross-Spec Dependencies**: Later specs build on validated earlier implementations
